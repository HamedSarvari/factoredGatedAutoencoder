Done on this branch :   Sequential_nonlinear_2g
Cost is combination of gen and disc as below:
cost = 0.1*cost_gen + cost_desc
normlaization problem for disc is solved compared to exp1
---------------------------------------------------------
exp3:

in disc_training only use cost_disc to update weights. 
cost = cost_desc
